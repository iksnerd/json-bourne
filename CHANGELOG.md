# Changelog

All notable changes are listed here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and the project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/). Before 1.0, the Go API (packages `jb` and `sdk`) and the CLI flags may change between minor versions.

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- `jb.HuntCase(ctx, caseDir, opts)`: hunt inside a case with the rules of `jb hunt --case` (case checks, evidence-directory git guard, actor files for the fingerprint detector, store under the case's evidence directory, the case's default window).

- `jb.Watch(ctx, caseDir, opts)`: the named watcher loop of `jb watch` (own state, log and lock per name, TTL dedupe, retention only of its own runs, one watcher per name). A cycle that did not finish is `CycleIncomplete`, never quiet.

### Fixed
- Release workflow uploaded `jb_test.go` as a release asset; it now uploads only the archives and checksums.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-11-06

First tagged release.

### Added
- `jb` CLI: `hunt`, `activity`, `actor status`, `watch`, `intel`, `estate`, `case check`, `doctor`, `db` and `serve`.
- Go package `github.com/iksnerd/json-bourne` (`jb`): `LoadConfig` and `Hunt`.
- Go package `github.com/iksnerd/json-bourne/sdk`: the plugin side for writing mapper plugins, standard library only.
- Example mapper plugins under `plugins/`: `jsondoc`, `kvlines`, `regexlines`.
